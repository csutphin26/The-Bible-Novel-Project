title: A Promise in the Sky
---

The bow was in the clouds. A promise hung over the world. The flood was behind them. The earth would endure. Seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night—they would not cease. God had said it. Noah had heard it. He and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives had stepped out of the ark into the light and the wind and the smell of wet earth. They had brought out every living thing. The animals had gone their way. The birds had taken to the air. The earth was empty and waiting.

God had blessed them. "Be fruitful and multiply," He had said. "Fill the earth." So they did. They had children. They planted. They built. The family of Noah spread. Shem had his sons. Ham had his. Japheth had his. The generations began again. The promise was still in the sky. When the rain came, the bow would appear in the clouds. God would remember. The waters would not rise again to destroy all flesh. Noah had built an altar when he stepped out of the ark. He had offered sacrifices. The Lord had smelled the pleasing aroma and had made a promise. Now the world went on under that promise.

Noah was a man of the soil. He had been the one who built the ark when the world had not believed. He had been the one who had waited in the dark while the waters rose. Now he planted a vineyard. He tended the vines. He waited for the grapes to ripen. Years passed. The vines grew. When the fruit was ready, he gathered it and pressed it and made wine. He drank. He did not know—or perhaps he did not care—how much. He lay in his tent, uncovered, lost to the world.

His son Ham came in and saw his father naked. He did not cover him. He did not turn away. He went out and told his two brothers, Shem and Japheth, what he had seen. Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it on their shoulders and walked backward into the tent. They did not look at their father. They covered him. When Noah awoke from his wine and learned what his youngest son had done to him, his heart turned. He spoke a curse. He spoke a blessing. He said, "Cursed be Canaan. The lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers." He said, "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem. Let Canaan be his slave. May God make space for Japheth, and let him live in the tents of Shem. Let Canaan be his slave also." So Noah spoke. So it would be. The same family that had stepped out of the ark under the promise had stumbled again. Violence had not been the only sin. Shame had entered in. A father's nakedness had been exposed. A son had been cursed. Two sons had been blessed. The world would go on. It would not be simple.

Noah lived three hundred fifty years after the flood. He lived nine hundred fifty years in all. Then he died. The promise was still in the sky. The bow would appear in the clouds when the rain came. God would remember. But the human heart had not changed. Noah's sons had sons. Their sons had sons. The earth filled with people again. The family of Shem, the family of Ham, the family of Japheth—they spread. They built cities. They became nations. They spoke one language. They moved east. They found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. They said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks and burn them hard. Let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens. Let us make a name for ourselves, so that we are not scattered over the face of the earth." They had heard the blessing. Be fruitful. Fill the earth. But they did not want to be scattered. They wanted to stay. They wanted a name. They wanted to reach the heavens with their own hands. So they began to build. The promise was still in the sky. They had turned their faces away from it.

Abraham had taken another wife, Keturah, and had more children. But he gave all he had to Isaac. To the sons of his concubines he gave gifts while he was still living, and he sent them away from his son Isaac, eastward to the east country. Abraham died at a good old age, old and full of years, and was gathered to his people. His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah. The promise had passed to Isaac. Isaac lived in the Negeb. He had married Rebekah, and for twenty years she bore him no children. Isaac prayed to the Lord for his wife, and the Lord granted his prayer. Rebekah conceived. But the children struggled together within her. She said, "If it is to be this way, why do I live?" She went to inquire of the Lord. The Lord said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples born of you shall be divided. The one shall be stronger than the other. The elder shall serve the younger." When her time to give birth had come, there were twins in her womb. The first came out red, all his body like a hairy mantle, so they named him Esau. Afterward his brother came out, with his hand gripping Esau's heel, so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when they were born. The two boys grew. Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents. Isaac loved Esau, because he was fond of game. Rebekah loved Jacob. The house was divided again. Not by a slave and a wife, but by a father's favor and a mother's.

Once when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau came in from the field and he was famished. Esau said to Jacob, "Let me eat some of that red stuff, for I am famished." Jacob said, "First sell me your birthright." Esau said, "I am about to die. Of what use is a birthright to me?" Jacob said, "Swear to me first." So he swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank and rose and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright. The promise had been passed to the firstborn. The firstborn had traded it for a bowl of stew. Jacob had taken it. He had not earned it. He had wanted it. The older would serve the younger. The word had been spoken before they were born. The choice had been made at a fire, in a tent, with a full belly and an empty hand.

Isaac grew old. His eyes were dim so that he could not see. He called his elder son Esau and said to him, "My son." And he said to him, "Here I am." He said, "I am old. I do not know the day of my death. Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me. Prepare for me savory food such as I like, and bring it to me to eat, so that I may bless you before I die." Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it, Rebekah said to her son Jacob, "I heard your father say to your brother Esau, 'Bring me game and prepare for me savory food to eat, that I may bless you before the Lord before I die.' Now therefore, my son, obey my word as I command you. Go to the flock and get me two choice kids, so that I may prepare from them savory food for your father, such as he likes. Then you shall take it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies." Jacob said to his mother Rebekah, "But my brother Esau is a hairy man and I am a smooth man. Perhaps my father will feel me and I shall seem to be mocking him and bring a curse on myself and not a blessing." His mother said to him, "Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my word and go get them for me." So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared savory food such as his father liked. Then Rebekah took the best garments of her elder son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob. She put the skins of the kids on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. Then she handed the savory food and the bread that she had prepared to her son Jacob. So he went in to his father and said, "My father." And he said, "Here I am. Who are you, my son?" Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Now sit up and eat of my game, so that you may bless me." Isaac said to his son, "How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?" He answered, "Because the Lord your God granted me success." Isaac said to Jacob, "Come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not." So Jacob went up to his father Isaac, who felt him and said, "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau." He did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands. So he blessed him. He said, "Are you really my son Esau?" He answered, "I am." Then he said, "Bring it to me, that I may eat of my son's game and bless you." So he brought it to him and he ate, and he brought him wine and he drank. Then his father Isaac said to him, "Come near and kiss me, my son." So he came near and kissed him, and Isaac smelled the smell of his garments and blessed him and said, "Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the Lord has blessed. May God give you of the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the earth and plenty of grain and wine. Let peoples serve you and nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you and blessed be everyone who blesses you." As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of his father Isaac, his brother Esau came in from his hunting. He also prepared savory food and brought it to his father. He said to his father, "Let my father sit up and eat of his son's game, so that you may bless me." His father Isaac said to him, "Who are you?" He answered, "I am your firstborn son, Esau." Then Isaac trembled violently and said, "Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me and I ate it all before you came and I have blessed him? Yes, and he shall be blessed." When Esau heard his father's words he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry and said to his father, "Bless me, me also, father!" But he said, "Your brother came with deceit and has taken away your blessing." Esau said, "Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright, and look, now he has taken away my blessing." Then he said, "Have you not reserved a blessing for me?" Isaac answered Esau, "I have already made him your lord, and I have given him all his brothers as servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?" Esau said to his father, "Have you only one blessing, father? Bless me, me also, father." And Esau lifted up his voice and wept. Then his father Isaac answered him, "See, away from the fatness of the earth shall your home be, and away from the dew of heaven on high. By your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother. But when you break loose you shall break his yoke from your neck." Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him. Esau said to himself, "The days of mourning for my father are approaching. Then I will kill my brother Jacob." The words were told to Rebekah. She sent and called her younger son Jacob and said to him, "Your brother Esau is consoling himself by planning to kill you. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran. Stay with him a while until your brother's fury turns away. When your brother's anger against you turns away and he forgets what you have done to him, I will send and bring you back from there." Rebekah said to Isaac, "I am weary of my life because of the Hittite women. If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women such as these, one of the women of the land, what good will my life be to me?" So Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and charged him, "You shall not marry one of the Canaanite women. Go at once to Paddan-aram to the house of Bethuel, your mother's father, and take as wife from there one of the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother. May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and numerous, that you may become a company of peoples. May he give to you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your offspring with you, so that you may take possession of the land where you now live as an alien, the land that God gave to Abraham." So Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother. Jacob had the blessing. He had the birthright. He did not have his brother's love. He did not have his home. He was leaving.

Jacob left Beersheba and went toward Haran. He came to a certain place and stayed there for the night because the sun had set. He took one of the stones of the place and put it under his head and lay down in that place. And he dreamed. There was a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. And the Lord stood beside him and said, "I am the Lord, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring. And your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you and in your offspring. Know that I am with you and will keep you wherever you go and will bring you back to this land, for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you." Then Jacob woke from his sleep and said, "Surely the Lord is in this place—and I did not know it." He was afraid and said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven." So Jacob rose early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. He called that place Bethel, though the name of the city was Luz at the first. Then Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear, so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then the Lord shall be my God, and this stone that I have set up for a pillar shall be God's house, and of all that you give me I will surely give one tenth to you." The blessing had been stolen. The brother had been wronged. The promise had not been taken back. God had met him on the road. The ladder had been set between earth and heaven. Jacob was no longer only a man who had grasped his brother's heel. He was the one who would carry the blessing. He did not know yet what it would cost him. He went on toward Haran.

When the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, no plant had yet sprung up and no herb had yet grown, because the Lord God had not yet sent rain on the earth. There was no one to work the ground. But a stream would rise from the earth and water the whole surface of the ground. Then the Lord God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. The man became a living being. The Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east. He put the man there. The garden was not a wilderness. It was a place of abundance—trees that were pleasant to the sight and good for food. In the middle of the garden stood the tree of life. And the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden. From there it divided and became four rivers. The man was not left with nothing to do. He was to work the ground and keep it. He was to care for what grew. He was to name what lived. The garden was his home and his work.

The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. And the Lord God commanded the man, "You may eat from any tree in the garden. But you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, because when you eat from it you will die." It was not a threat. It was the truth. God had made the man to live in trust, to care, and to choose. He had given him one clear boundary. The man listened. He had work to do. He had the whole garden before him—every tree, every fruit—except one.

Then the Lord God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper for him—a partner." So out of the ground the Lord God formed every animal of the field and every bird of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would call them. One by one they came. The cattle. The birds. The beasts of the field. Whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name. The man gave names to all the cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the field. He saw what was there. He spoke what fit. But for the man there was not found a helper as his partner. Among all the creatures there was no one like him—no one to stand beside him, no one to share the work and the wonder. The naming was done. The garden was full. And still the man was alone. So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man. He slept. He did not see what happened next. While he slept, the Lord God took one of his ribs and closed the opening with flesh. From the rib the Lord God had taken from the man, He made a woman. He brought her to the man. The man opened his eyes. He saw her. "This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh," he said. "She will be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man." She had been taken from man. Now the two would become one flesh. The man and his wife were both naked. They were not ashamed. There was no reason to be. There was nothing between them but trust.

The man and the woman stood in the garden together. They had work. They had each other. They had God’s goodness all around them—every tree, every fruit, the river, the animals they had named. They were naked and not ashamed. There was nothing to hide. No wrong between them. No wrong between them and God. The garden was their home. Trust was their way. For now.

Adam knew his wife Eve, and she conceived and bore Cain. She said, "I have produced a man with the help of the Lord." Next she bore his brother Abel. Abel kept flocks. Cain worked the ground. The two brothers grew. One tended the soil. One tended the sheep. They lived in the world outside the garden—the world of toil, the world where the ground did not give its strength easily. When the time came to bring an offering to the Lord, Abel brought the firstborn of his flock—the best he had, the first and finest—and the fat of those animals. He gave God his best. Cain brought an offering from the fruit of the ground. But he did not bring his best. He brought what was left over or bruised. He kept the good fruit for himself. The Lord had regard for Abel and his offering. He did not have regard for Cain and his offering. Cain was angry. His face fell. He could not hide what he felt.

The Lord said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why has your face fallen? If you do well, will you not be accepted? If you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door. Its desire is for you, but you must master it." Cain said nothing. He did not master it. The anger did not leave him. It sat at the door. It waited. Cain went out to the field where Abel was. He had come looking for his brother. When he found him, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him. The first brother had become a murderer. The first blood had been spilled on the ground. Abel’s blood. And Cain walked away.

The Lord said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" Cain said, "I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?" The Lord said, "What have you done? Listen. Your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground. And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. When you work the ground, it will no longer give you its strength. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth." Cain said to the Lord, "My punishment is greater than I can bear. Today you have driven me away from the soil, and I will be hidden from your face. I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and anyone who finds me may kill me." The Lord said to him, "Not so. Whoever kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over." And the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him. Then Cain went away from the presence of the Lord and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden. No land would be his. No place would hold him. He would never truly rest.

Adam and Eve were left with the silence. Abel was gone. Cain was gone. The first brother had become a murderer. The first blood had been spilled. Violence had entered the world. It would not be the last.

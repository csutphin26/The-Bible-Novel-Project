The serpent was more crafty than any other wild animal that the Lord God had made. One day it came to the woman. "Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?" it asked. The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat from the fruit of the trees in the garden. But God said, 'You must not eat from the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.'" The serpent said to the woman, "You will not die. God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil." The woman looked at the tree. The fruit was good to look at. It was a delight to the eyes. It seemed good for food. She wanted what the serpent had promised—to be like God, to know good and evil. She reached out. She took some of its fruit and ate. She gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate. At once the eyes of both were opened. They knew that they were naked. They had never known it before. Now they could not unsee it. They were ashamed. They sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves. They had crossed the line. They had broken the one command. Now they hid from themselves—and from each other—behind what they had made.

Later they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze. The man and the woman hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden. They did not run toward Him. They ran away. But the Lord God called to the man and said to him, "Where are you?" The man said, "I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself." God said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?" The man said, "The woman you gave to be with me—she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate." Then the Lord God said to the woman, "What is this that you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent tricked me, and I ate." So the Lord God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, you are cursed above all animals and all wild creatures. You will crawl on your belly, and you will eat dust for the rest of your life. You will be the enemy of the woman and of her offspring. He will strike your head, and you will strike his heel." To the woman He said, "I will greatly increase your pain in childbearing; you will give birth in pain. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you." And to the man He said, "Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat from it,' the ground is cursed because of you. Work will no longer be the good care of the garden—it will be hard, sweaty toil. The ground will produce thorns and thistles for you. By the sweat of your face you will eat bread until you return to the ground, because you were taken from it. You are dust, and to dust you will return."

The man named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all living. The Lord God made garments of skin for the man and for his wife, and clothed them. Then the Lord God said, "The man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now he might reach out his hand and take from the tree of life too, and eat, and live forever." So the Lord God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to work the ground from which he was taken. He drove the man out. East of the garden of Eden He placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life. The garden was behind them now. The choice had been made. Trust had been broken. The world they had known was gone.

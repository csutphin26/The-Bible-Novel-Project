Before anything else existed, there was God. There was no sky yet, no land, no sea. No shape. No movement. Darkness covered everything—not because something was wrong, but because nothing had been shaped yet. Everything was still. The world was waiting.

Then God spoke. Light appeared. It did not push or fight; it did not struggle to be seen. It came at once, as if it had been waiting to hear His voice. The darkness moved aside. For the first time the world could be seen. God looked at the light and said it was good. He separated the light from the dark. Light became day. Dark became night. Time began to move. There was evening and there was morning—the first day.

God spoke again. The waters shifted. Space opened between what was above and what was below. The sky stretched wide, a great expanse holding the waters apart—waters above and waters below. God named the sky. Heaven. Then the waters under the sky gathered into one place. Dry ground appeared. The land became firm and ready. God named the land Earth and the gathered waters Seas. The earth was no longer a formless deep. It had shape. It had place. There was evening and there was morning—the second day.

Now the ground could bear life. God said, "Let the earth produce vegetation: plants that yield seed, and fruit trees of every kind that bear fruit with the seed in it." And it was so. Plants grew from the soil. Grass spread across the land. Trees rose up and bore fruit, each with seeds inside, so that life had a way to continue. The earth was no longer only rock and water. It was green. It was alive. God saw that it was good. There was evening and there was morning—the third day.

God filled the sky with lights. One bright light ruled the day. A softer light watched over the night. Many others filled the heavens—countless points of light, fixed in their places. They were not gods. They were signs. They marked days, seasons, and years. They gave light on the earth. There was evening and there was morning—the fourth day.

God said, "Let the waters produce swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the dome of the sky." So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, of every kind, that fills the waters, and every winged bird of every kind. The seas began to stir. Living creatures moved in the deep—great and small, everything that swam. They moved and multiplied. The waters were full of life. Then the sky filled with birds. They flew above the earth. They cried out. God blessed them. He said, "Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth." There was evening and there was morning—the fifth day.

God said, "Let the earth produce living creatures of every kind: livestock and creatures that creep and wild animals of the earth of every kind." And it was so. God made the wild animals of every kind, the livestock of every kind, and everything that creeps on the ground of every kind. The land brought forth animals. Some were strong. Some were small. Some were wild. Some would one day live close to people. They ran. They crept. They filled the hills and the valleys. The world was full now—sky and sea and land, each with its own life. God saw that it was good. But still something was missing. There was no one to care for it. No one to name it. No one to stand in the world as God’s own.

God did not speak from far away this time. He came close. He formed a man from the dust of the ground. The body lay still—complete, but without life. God bent close. He breathed into the man’s nostrils the breath of life. Life entered him. The man opened his eyes. Light was above him. Ground was beneath him. Breath was inside him. He was alive. He was a living being.

God had made people to be like Him—not in how they looked, but in how they were meant to live. He gave them work to do. Not to rule with force, but to care for what He had made. To fill the earth. To tend it. God blessed them. "Be fruitful and multiply," He said. "Fill the earth and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves on the earth." He gave them every plant and every tree for food. The animals too would have their food. Everything had its place. God looked at everything He had made—the light, the land, the sky, the sea, the plants, the animals, the man. It was all very good. There was evening and there was morning—the sixth day. The work of creation was complete.

Then the heavens and the earth were finished. God rested. Not because He was tired, but because the work was complete. He had finished the work that He had done. Rest became part of the world. The seventh day was set apart. Everything stood whole. The story had begun. For now.

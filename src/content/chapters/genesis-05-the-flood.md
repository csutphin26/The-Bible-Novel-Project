The earth filled with people. Generation followed generation. But the violence that had begun with Cain did not stay with Cain. It spread. It grew. People did what was wrong in the sight of God. They took what was not theirs. They harmed one another. Corruption was everywhere. God looked at the world He had made—at the wickedness of humankind, at the way every thought of the human heart was bent toward evil—and He was grieved. He was grieved to His heart. The world He had called good had turned away from Him. So God said, "I will blot out from the earth the human beings I have created—people together with animals and creeping things and birds of the air—for I am sorry that I have made them." But Noah found favor in the eyes of God.

Noah was a righteous man. In that generation, he was blameless. He walked with God. He had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. God said to Noah, "I have determined to make an end of all flesh. The earth is filled with violence because of them. I am going to destroy them with the earth. Make yourself an ark." God told Noah how to build it: so many cubits long, so many wide, so many high. A window here. A door in the side. Lower, second, and third decks. The ark would be a vessel that could float—a refuge when the waters came. God said, "I am going to bring a flood of waters on the earth. Everything on earth that has the breath of life will die. But I will establish my covenant with you. You will come into the ark—you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives. Bring two of every kind of living thing, male and female, to keep them alive with you. Take every kind of food that is eaten and store it up. It will be food for you and for them." Noah did this. He did all that God commanded him.

Building the ark took a long time. Years. Noah chose the wood. He cut the timbers. He fitted the decks. He made the window and the door. He did not know the day when the flood would come, but he knew that it would come. He worked while the world went on as before—eating, drinking, marrying, giving in marriage—until the day Noah entered the ark. God had said to him, "Go into the ark with all your household. I have seen that you alone are righteous before me in this generation. Take seven pairs of every clean animal, male and female, and one pair of every animal that is not clean. Take seven pairs of the birds of the air as well, so that their kind may live on the earth. In seven days I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights. Every living thing I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground." Noah did all that God commanded him. He was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth. He and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives went into the ark with him. The animals went in as God had commanded—two and two, male and female, of every creature that had the breath of life in it. And the Lord shut them in.

Then the rain began. It fell on the earth forty days and forty nights. The fountains of the great deep burst forth. The windows of the heavens were opened. Water rose from below and poured from above. The waters increased and bore up the ark, and it floated high above the earth. The waters swelled and increased greatly on the earth. The ark floated on the face of the waters. Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in it died. Birds, cattle, wild animals, creeping things, and every human being. Everything on dry land died. God blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground—human beings and animals and creeping things and birds of the air. They were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark. The waters swelled on the earth for one hundred fifty days.

Inside the ark there was only the sound of the rain, then the silence of the deep. The world outside was gone. Noah and his family and the animals lived in the close, wooden dark. They did not know when the waters would go down. They waited. God remembered Noah. God remembered all the wild animals and all the domestic animals that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided. The fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed. The rain from the heavens was restrained. The waters gradually receded from the earth. At the end of one hundred fifty days the waters had decreased. In the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. The waters continued to decrease until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.

After forty more days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made and sent out the raven. It flew back and forth until the waters had dried up from the earth. Then he sent out the dove to see if the waters had gone down from the surface of the ground. But the dove found no place to land. It came back to him in the ark, because the waters still covered the whole earth. He put out his hand and took it and brought it into the ark with him. He waited another seven days and again sent out the dove from the ark. The dove came back to him in the evening, and there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had gone down from the earth. He waited another seven days and sent out the dove again. This time it did not return to him. So Noah knew the ground was dry. He removed the covering of the ark and looked. The surface of the ground was dry. But Noah did not step out until God spoke.

God said to Noah, "Go out of the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons' wives with you. Bring out with you every living thing that is with you—birds and animals and every creature that moves on the earth—so they can fill the earth and be fruitful and multiply." So Noah went out with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives. And every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird—everything that moves on the earth—went out of the ark by families. Noah built an altar to the Lord. He took some of every clean animal and every clean bird and offered them as burnt offerings on the altar. And when the Lord smelled the pleasing aroma, the Lord said in his heart, "I will never again curse the ground because of humankind, for the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth. Nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done. As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, will not cease."

God blessed Noah and his sons. He said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth." Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him, "I am establishing my covenant with you and your descendants after you, and with every living creature that came out of the ark with you—the birds, the animals, everything. I promise you: never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood. Never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth." God said, "This is the sign of the covenant I make with you and every living creature, for all future generations. I have set my bow in the clouds. It will be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth. When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds, I will remember my covenant. The waters will never again become a flood to destroy all flesh."

Noah looked up. The bow was in the clouds. A promise hung over the world. The flood was behind them. The earth would endure.

Sarai had no children. The promise had been given—offspring like the stars, a nation from Abram—but years had passed and her womb had stayed closed. She had an Egyptian slave named Hagar. Sarai said to Abram, "You see that the Lord has prevented me from bearing children. Go in to my slave. Perhaps I shall obtain children through her." Abram listened to Sarai. He went in to Hagar, and she conceived. When she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress. Sarai said to Abram, "May the wrong done to me be on you. I gave my slave to you, and when she saw that she had conceived she looked on me with contempt. May the Lord judge between you and me." Abram said to Sarai, "Your slave is in your power. Do to her as you please." So Sarai dealt harshly with her, and Hagar fled.

She went into the wilderness. She had nowhere to go. She was carrying a child she had not asked for, running from a house that was no longer a home. The angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, on the way to Shur. The angel said, "Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?" She said, "I am running away from my mistress Sarai." The angel said to her, "Return to your mistress and submit to her." The angel said, "I will so greatly multiply your offspring that they cannot be counted. You are now pregnant and shall bear a son. You shall name him Ishmael, for the Lord has given heed to your affliction. He shall be a wild ass of a man, with his hand against everyone and everyone's hand against him. He shall live at odds with all his kin." So Hagar named the Lord who had spoken to her, "You are El-roi," for she said, "Have I really seen God and remained alive after seeing Him?" She returned. She bore Abram a son, and Abram named him Ishmael. Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael. The promise had not yet come through Sarai. The household had grown. It had also been broken.

When Abram was ninety-nine years old the Lord appeared to him and said, "I am God Almighty. Walk before me and be blameless. And I will make my covenant between me and you and will make you exceedingly numerous." Abram fell on his face. God said to him, "As for me, this is my covenant with you: You shall be the ancestor of a multitude of nations. No longer shall your name be Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, for I have made you the ancestor of a multitude of nations. I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come from you. I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you. And I will give to you and to your offspring after you the land where you are now an alien, all the land of Canaan, for a perpetual holding, and I will be their God." God said to Abraham, "As for you, you shall keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations. This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised." God said, "As for your wife Sarai, you shall not call her Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name. I will bless her and moreover give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she shall give rise to nations; kings of peoples shall come from her." Abraham fell on his face and laughed. He said to himself, "Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Can Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?" Abraham said to God, "O that Ishmael might live in your sight!" God said, "No, but your wife Sarah shall bear you a son, and you shall name him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his offspring after him. As for Ishmael, I have heard you. I will bless him and make him fruitful and exceedingly numerous. He shall be the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation. But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this season next year." So Abraham took his son Ishmael and all his slaves, every male in his household, and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very day, as God had said to him. Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised. Ishmael was thirteen. The covenant was cut into the flesh. The promise had a name now: Isaac.

The Lord appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the entrance of his tent in the heat of the day. He looked up and saw three men standing near him. He ran from the tent entrance to meet them and bowed down to the ground. He said, "My lord, if I find favor with you, do not pass by your servant. Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree. Let me bring a little bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on—since you have come to your servant." So they said, "Do as you have said." Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah and said, "Make ready three measures of choice flour, knead it, and make cakes." He ran to the herd and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to the servant, who hastened to prepare it. He took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared and set it before them, and he stood by them under the tree while they ate. They said to him, "Where is your wife Sarah?" He said, "There, in the tent." Then one said, "I will surely return to you in due season, and your wife Sarah shall have a son." Sarah was listening at the tent entrance behind him. Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age. Sarah had ceased to have the manner of women. So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, "After I have grown old, and my husband is old, shall I have pleasure?" The Lord said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?' Is anything too wonderful for the Lord? At the set time I will return to you, in due season, and Sarah shall have a son." But Sarah denied it, saying, "I did not laugh," for she was afraid. He said, "Oh yes, you did laugh." The strangers had come. The promise had been spoken again. Sarah had laughed. The child would still come.

The men set out from there and looked toward Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on their way. The Lord said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do? Abraham shall become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him. No, I will make known to him what I am about to do." So the Lord said, "How great is the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah and how very grave their sin! I must go down and see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me. And if not, I will know." The men turned and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the Lord. Abraham came near and said, "Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you then sweep away the place and not forgive it for the fifty righteous who are in it? Far be it from you to do such a thing—to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?" The Lord said, "If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will forgive the whole place for their sake." Abraham answered, "I have dared to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes. Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking. Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?" He said, "I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there." Abraham spoke again: "Suppose forty are found there." He said, "For the sake of forty I will not do it." "Suppose thirty are found there." "I will not do it if I find thirty there." "Suppose twenty are found there." "For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it." "Suppose ten are found there." He said, "For the sake of ten I will not destroy it." And the Lord went his way when he had finished speaking to Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place. He had asked. God had listened. Sodom had not changed.

Two angels came to Sodom in the evening. Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them he rose to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. He said, "Please, my lords, turn aside to your servant's house and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you can rise early and go on your way." They said, "No, we will spend the night in the square." But he urged them strongly, so they turned aside to him and entered his house. He made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house. They called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we may know them." Lot went out of the door to the men, shut the door after him, and said, "I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly. Look, I have two daughters who have not known a man. Let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please. Only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof." They said, "Stand back! This fellow came here as an alien, and he would play the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them." They pressed hard against Lot and came near the door to break it down. But the men inside reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door. And they struck with blindness the men who were at the door of the house, both small and great, so that they were unable to find the door. The angels said to Lot, "Have you anyone else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone you have in the city—bring them out of this place. For we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against them has become great before the Lord, and the Lord has sent us to destroy it." Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, "Up, get out of this place, for the Lord is about to destroy the city." But he seemed to them to be jesting. When morning dawned the angels urged Lot, saying, "Get up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be consumed in the punishment of the city." He lingered. So the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the Lord being merciful to him, and they brought him out and left him outside the city. They said, "Flee for your life. Do not look back or stop anywhere in the plain. Flee to the hills, or you will be consumed." Lot said to them, "Oh no, my lords. Your servant has found favor with you and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life, but I cannot flee to the hills, for fear the disaster will overtake me and I die. Look, that city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there—is it not a little one?—and my life will be saved." He said to him, "Very well, I will grant you this favor too. I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. Hurry, escape there, for I can do nothing until you arrive there." The sun had risen on the earth when Lot entered Zoar. Then the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the Lord out of heaven. He overthrew those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and what grew on the ground. Lot's wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the Lord. He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain, and he saw the smoke of the land going up like the smoke of a furnace. So it was that when God destroyed the cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow. Lot had chosen the plain. The plain was gone. He had been a stranger. He was a stranger still. The covenant had not been for Sodom. It had been for the one who had walked away from the gate and gone back to his tent and waited for the Lord to do what was just.

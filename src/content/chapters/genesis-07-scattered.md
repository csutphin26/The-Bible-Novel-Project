They had one language and the same words. They had moved east. They had found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. They said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks and burn them hard." So they made bricks and used mortar instead of stone. They said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens. Let us make a name for ourselves, so that we are not scattered over the face of the earth." They had heard the blessing. Be fruitful. Fill the earth. But they did not want to be scattered. They wanted to stay. They wanted a name. They wanted to reach the heavens with their own hands. So they began to build.

The Lord came down to see the city and the tower that the humans were building. He saw what they were doing. One people. One language. Nothing would now be impossible for them. They had set their hearts on a single thing: to make a name for themselves, to gather in one place, to climb. So the Lord said, "Look, they are one people, and they all have one language. This is only the beginning of what they will do. Nothing they propose to do will now be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language there, so that they will not understand one another's speech." So the Lord scattered them from there over the face of all the earth. They stopped building the city. That is why it was called Babel—because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth, and from there the Lord scattered them over the face of all the earth.

They could no longer understand one another. The words that had been shared became a noise. The work stopped. The tower was left unfinished. The city was left behind. Families went one way and another. They took their language with them—or rather, the language they had become. They spread. They filled the earth. Not because they had chosen to. Because they had no choice. They could not stay. They could not build their name to the sky. God had scattered them. The blessing would be fulfilled in a way they had not wanted. The earth would be filled. The nations would rise. But first they would be scattered.

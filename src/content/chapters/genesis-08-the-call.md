The nations had spread. The family of Shem had spread. Among them was Terah, the father of Abram. Abram had a wife named Sarai. She had no children. Terah took his son Abram and his grandson Lot, the son of Abram's brother who had died, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, and they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan. But they came to Haran and settled there. Terah died in Haran. Abram was left with the promise of a land he had not yet reached.

Then the Lord said to Abram, "Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you. I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed." Abram went. He did not know where he was going. He took his wife Sarai and his nephew Lot and all the possessions they had gathered and the persons they had acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan. They arrived. The Lord appeared to Abram and said, "To your offspring I will give this land." So Abram built an altar there to the Lord. He moved on. He built another altar. He called on the name of the Lord. He was a stranger in the land. The land was not yet his. But the promise was.

A famine came. The land could not feed them. Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while. As they came near Egypt he said to Sarai, "I know that you are a woman of beauty. When the Egyptians see you they will say, 'This is his wife,' and they will kill me and keep you. Say you are my sister, so that it may go well with me because of you and I may live." So when they entered Egypt the Egyptians saw that she was very beautiful. The officials of Pharaoh saw her and praised her to Pharaoh. She was taken into Pharaoh's house. Abram was treated well because of her. He had sheep and cattle and donkeys and servants. But the Lord struck Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai. Pharaoh called Abram and said, "What have you done to me? Why did you not tell me she was your wife? Take her and go." Pharaoh sent them away. Abram went up out of Egypt with his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him. They returned to the place where Abram had built the first altar, between Bethel and Ai. Abram called on the name of the Lord there. The promise had not been taken from him. But he had not yet learned to rest in it.

Abram and Lot had become very wealthy. The land could not hold them both. Their herdsmen quarreled. Abram said to Lot, "Let there be no strife between you and me, or between your herdsmen and my herdsmen. We are kindred. Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, I will go to the right. If you take the right hand, I will go to the left." Lot looked. He saw the plain of the Jordan, well watered, like the garden of the Lord. He chose the plain. He moved his tents as far as Sodom. The people of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the Lord. Lot did not seem to see it. Or he did not care. Abram remained in the land of Canaan. Lot settled among the cities of the plain. The Lord said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, "Look from the place where you are. Look north and south and east and west. All the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever. I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth. So that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted. Rise up, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you." Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre at Hebron. There he built an altar to the Lord. The land was still not his. But the promise was. He had no child. But the promise was.

Abram said, "O Lord God, what will you give me? I am childless. The heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus." The Lord said, "This man shall not be your heir. No one but your very own offspring shall be your heir." The Lord brought him outside and said, "Look toward heaven and count the stars, if you are able to count them. So shall your offspring be." Abram believed the Lord. The Lord reckoned it to him as righteousness. Then the Lord said to him, "I am the Lord who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess." Abram said, "O Lord God, how am I to know that I shall possess it?" The Lord said to him, "Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon." Abram brought them. He cut them in two and laid each half over against the other. He did not cut the birds in two. When birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away. As the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a deep and terrifying darkness descended upon him. The Lord said to Abram, "Know this for certain: your offspring shall be aliens in a land that is not theirs. They shall be oppressed for four hundred years. But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions. You shall go to your ancestors in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age. And they shall come back here in the fourth generation." When the sun had gone down and it was dark, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between the pieces. On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your offspring I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates." The call had been given. The promise had been sealed. Abram had nothing yet. He had the word of God. That was enough.

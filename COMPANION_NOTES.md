# Companion Workbook Notes

This file is for **reader questions and confusions** to add to the companion workbooks later. As you read each chapter, note anything that made you pause, ask "what does that mean?", or want to dig deeper. When you build the companion workbook for each book, you can pull from here for **What Might Be Confusing (and That's OK)** and **Questions for Reflection**.

## Genesis — Beginnings

### Chapter 2 — The Garden

- **Two trees in the center.**  
  God placed two trees in the middle of the garden (the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil) but only commanded Adam not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. After they ate from it, God was worried they would eat from the tree of life and “live forever like Us” — so He drove them out and guarded the way.

- **Was it OK to eat from the tree of life before the fall?**  
  (The story doesn’t forbid it before; only the one tree was forbidden. So was the tree of life allowed until they disobeyed?)

- **“Us” — is that God and Jesus?**  
  When God says “like one of us” / “live forever like Us,” who is “Us”? God and Jesus? (Something to explore in the companion workbook.)

### Chapter 3 — The Choice

- **What is "set against"?**  
  (Clarified in chapter: the serpent would be the *enemy* of the woman and her offspring.)

- **Why is pain in childbearing?**  
  Was God upset that they blamed others and didn’t take ownership of their mistakes?

- **How was the ground cursed?**  
  Did that mean work was no longer good—that keeping food growing was no longer simple—but that now it would be hard and painful?

- **Was this all a punishment for disobeying God?**

- **What are cherubim?**  
  (I don’t know what cherubim is.)

- **What is the point of the flaming sword?**  
  Is it mentioned again in the Bible anywhere else? Does it block them? Does it make the way invisible? Can they not cross around it? (Questions others would likely have too.)

### Chapter 4 — Brothers

- **Abel brought an offering from the firstborn of his flock and from their fat.**  
  What does "firstborn" and "from their fat" mean? Why did that matter?

- **What mark was put on Cain?**  
  (The story doesn’t say what the mark was—just that God put a mark on him so no one who found him would kill him.)

- **Does Adam and Eve know about all of this?**  
  Did God tell them, or did Abel disappear and Cain was just cast out?

- **Did Adam and Eve have other children as well?**
